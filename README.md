## (Alexa Marvel Cinematic Universe Skill)

Give your Amazon Echo / Dot the power of the Marvel Cinematic Universe!

What's more it's super easy to remix this project to make Alexa answer the world's questions about your favourite game / movie / TV show etc.

This project demonstrates how to build an Alexa skill - no Amazon Echo required! It's a great project to learn the basics of creating Alexa Skills. 

It uses Gabriel Pedro's [node-wikia](https://github.com/gpedro/node-wikia) , which fetches data from Wookieepedia and can be remixed to work with any of the 360,000+ [wikia](http://wikia.com/) fandom sites! So you can easily set up Alexa to answer questions on your favourite game in less than an hour.
